abstract = {The Department of Homeland Security is sponsoring development of standards for urban search and rescue (USAR) robots. This program is being coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and will result in consensus standards developed through ASTM International. Robot deployment categories and performance requirements have been identified by emergency responders, These requirements are being translated into tests and metrics with which to measure the performance of robots. Several test methods have been entered into the standards process. Three major exercises have been held at US&R training facilities, in which responders work side-by-side with robot manufacturers to experiment with robot deployments in relevant scenarios and to refine and expand performance requirements. To date, over forty robots, including ground, aerial, and aquatic, have been involved. Supporting projects are developing an ontology of robot capabilities and situational constraints. In general, these efforts will enable responders to enhance their effectiveness while reducing risk to personnel during disasters through use of robotic assets. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Mobile robots and many edge AI devices have a need to trade off computational power against power consumption, battery size, and time between charges. Consequently, it is common for such devices to have significantly less computational power than the powerful GPU-based systems typically used to train and evaluate deep neural networks. Object detection is a key aspect of visual perception for robots and edge devices but popular object detection architectures that run fastest on GPU based systems or that are designed to maximize mAP with large input image sizes may not scale well to edge devices. In this work we evaluate the latency and mAP of several model architectures from the YOLO and SSD families on a range of devices representative of robot and edge device capabilities. We also evaluate the effect of runtime framework and show that some unexpected large differences can be found. Based on our evaluations we propose new variations of the YOLO-LITE architecture which we show can provide increased mAP at reduced latency.},

abstract = {We present our recent work on the electrical and hardware design of the multi-robot mobile platform WeeMiK. The goal of this project was to develop a low-cost and robust but extensible platform for research and educational purpose especially in swarm robotics. WeeMiK structure enables large-scale innovative, new curriculum, multi-agent research and mobile robot outreach to artificial intelligent students. We introduce WeeMiK platform, which offers a balance between capabilities, accessibility, cost and an open-design with open source programing SDK. All of electrical structure include sensors, motor drive, wireless communication system and device communication manager (DCM), are designed based on a 8-Bit AVR micro-controller that runs under Real-Time Operating System (freeRTOS) with tasks scheduling. With a range of different sensors like inertia navigation system (INS), IR ring for both transceiver data besides proximity, wireless communication and omnidirectional locomotion system, not only WeeMiK can interact with environment in multiple ways, but it also able to communicate with the other WeeMiKs and or PC, therefore it can be used in various swarm robotic scenarios. We demonstrate the usability of our concept by quantifying the obstacle avoidance task and also briefly describe the software design based on Arduino and freeRTOS framework for educational usage.},

abstract = {In Automatic Driving System (ADS) and Driver Assistance System (DAS), object detection plays a vital part. Nevertheless, existing real-time detection models for tiny vehicle objects have the problems of low precision and poor performance. To solve these issues, we propose a novel real-time object detection model based on You Only Look Once Version 2 (YOLO-v2) deep learning framework for tiny vehicle objects, called Optimized You Only Look Once Version 2 (O-YOLO-v2). In the proposed model, a new structure is introduced to strengthen the feature extraction ability of the network by adding convolution layers at different locations. Meanwhile, the problem of gradient disappearance or dispersion caused by increasing network depth is solved by adding residual modules. Furthermore, in order to promote the detection accuracy of tiny vehicle objects, we combine the low-level features and high-level features of the network. The experimental findings and analysis on a KITTI dataset show that the model not only promotes the accuracy of tiny vehicle object detection but also improves the accuracy of vehicle detection (the accuracy reaches 94%) without decreasing the detection speed.},

By analysing the results, we draw some conclusions related to this RTOS’s evolution which can be useful for the FreeRTOS group, other RTOS developments, and also RTOS users.}
